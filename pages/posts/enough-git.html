<h1>Just enough Git for a hackathon!</h1>

<p>This is a short tutorial to understand and use enough of Git you need for a hackathon</p>

<h3>What is Git?</h3>
<p>Git is a (collaborative) decentralized version control system. Let's understand each part one by one.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Version control system</strong>: A version control system is a software which is used to store your code in such a way that each set of changes is stored separately. For example, you have a website initially. You add a home page to it. Make it one part. Now you added another page - about, this will be stored in a different part. We will learn why we need it soon!</li>
  <li><strong>Collaborative</strong>: Git is mostly a collaboration tool, it lets multiple people to work on a project at the same time.</li>
  <li><strong>Decentalized</strong>: The code is not stored at one place. It is present in the devices of all collaborators working on the project. This feature also makes it a bit complicated to work with, especially in a non-networked ecosystem, that's where GitHub comes in.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Why do we need it?</h3>

<p>Before we start let's understand some basic terminologies, I will be using normal file system terminologies for simpler explainations:</p>

<p><strong>Repository</strong>: TODO</p>
<p><strong>Branch</strong>: TODO</p>

<p>Enough talk, let's jump in!<p>

<h2>Git CLI/Git Bash: The Hard Way</h2>
<p>Start by creating a repository</p>
<code>git init</code>
