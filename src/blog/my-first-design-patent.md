## [The Background](#the-background)

This all started in November 2025 when me and my team were focusing on Smart India Hackathon (SIH) 2025. After a lot of back and forth, we decided to work on developing an apparatus to detech microplastic in water (size 1nm to 5nm).

<br />

Fast forward a few days, we decided to apply for a Design Patent. By December 24, we were granted the <a href='https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Mad21CTfMV6lU9x07AvYQMc4RFF8G_ET/view?usp=drive_link' target='_blank'>design patent</a>.

## [Tech Stack](#tech-stack)

The apparatus is an IoT enabled micro-controller device in a portable form factor. We used ESP32 for this project for its versatility and affordability.

<br />

The software side consists of backend written in Python and Flask and frontend being written in React

## [Conclusion](#conclusion)

Overall it was a great learning and working experience and I'm looking forward to doing more such projects with my team in future. Hope you liked my first blog post!
